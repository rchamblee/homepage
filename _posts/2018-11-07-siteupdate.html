<ul>
  <li>HTTP server migrated to <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>. This was a good idea no matter what considering I was using a python script as the prior http server. Setup was fairly easy and uptime is ~99.5% right now, loving it so far.</li>
  <li>Loads of changes to the stylesheet since the site first rolled out</li>
  <li>Implemented a system for tagging posts, still using nothing more than jekyll.</li>
</ul>

Might not seem like a lot, but considering I work on this website (( when I feel like it )), working 9 to 11 hours a day at my job, I feel like it's progress. As always, this whole website, including jekyll templates, are hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/rchamblee/homepage-build">Github</a>.
